Contains all code needed to run simulations of collapse of turbulent, star forming clouds with non-ionizing UV feedback. Folders contained are:

    1) Athena: Code and input files used to run simulations on cluster
    2) Python: Code used to analyze the Athena .hst, PDF and flux outputs
    3) Visit: Code used with Visit to plot density slices and surface density projections of simulations from vtk dumps
